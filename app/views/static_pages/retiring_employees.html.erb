This is why we ask you to enter your salary the first time you use Retirement Money. This number is an estimate of the income you may need in retirement to maintain your standard of living. This number represents an accepted standard in the financial services industry and should only be viewed as a starting point for your retirement planning. Every individual's needs are unique.</p>

              <p>The 100% of your pre-retirement income may not be required to maintain your standard of living in retirement because your expenses may change when you stop working. Some expense may go down or away, such as taxes and work related expenses, while some may go up, like health care costs and money you spend on new hobbies or activities. Some examples of expenses that typically go down.Living expenses and spending habits typically drop over the course of a 30 year retirement equating to a 5-15% reduction in annual spending.</p> </div>

            <div class="accordion-inner"><p>Retirement income estimates for your current account balance, future contributions, employer contributions (if applicable), and other assets set aside for retirement are for illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed. Income estimates assume you make a lump sum purchase of a single life immediate annuity at retirement which would pay you a level income amount each month as long as you live. Using this annuity assumption allows us to translate your projected retirement portfolio into terms that are similar to other retirement income sources like Social Security or any pension benefits. The estimated income amount shown is the income you would receive at retirement in terms of today's dollars. Note that inflation will erode your spending power over time. The projected amount of the annuity income payment is based on the combination of the Society of Actuaries' Annuity Basic Mortality Table and recent Immediate Annuity interest rates from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.Please keep in mind that this approach to generating your income estimate does not constitute a recommendation to purchase an annuity at retirement. Each individual's retirement needs are different so an annuity purchase may or may not make sense for you.</p>
